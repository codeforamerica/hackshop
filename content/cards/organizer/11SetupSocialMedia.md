### Setup your Social Media

Set up your social media hashtag a few weeks before your event. For CodeAcross, we use the #codeacross hashtag and for National Day of Civic Hacking we use #hackforchange. If you have your own hashtag that you use for your regular Brigade meetups - you can use that too.

Tweeting and posting throughout the day will help encourage other people in the community as well as help set up a timeline of events. This will make it easier to blog about your event later.
