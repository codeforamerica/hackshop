### Provide Pre-Event Resources

You also shouldn’t wait until the day of the event to provide your participants with resources. 

By providing a resource list ahead of time it helps get participants better prepare for the event. 

Hackathons may have challenge components, but that doesn’t mean everyone absolutely has to start from scratch.

Good examples of pre-event resources can be  user stories, data sets, and contact information for subject matter experts who have agreed to coach participants.
