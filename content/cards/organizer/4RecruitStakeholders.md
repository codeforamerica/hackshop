### Recruit Stakeholders

Hackathons work best when focused on a specific problem set. Want to do a hackathon about crime? Better call the police department. Want to do something around housing? Recruit somebody from the local housing authority or somebody who runs a shelter. When trying to think about the needs and challenges of the front line, thereâ€™s no substitute for somebody who actually works in that space to speak at your event and to help you identify the right problems to be solved. 

- [ ] Decide on one or two themes for your event
- [ ] Bring in 2-3 subject matter experts who deal with the problems within the context of your theme(s) on a daily basis
