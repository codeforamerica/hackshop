### Recruit Participants

Once you have an agenda, it’s time to Recruit! Recruit! Recruit! People can get pretty busy and people can get even busier during the summer. In order to get people to your event you’ll need to start early. You can use your local organization’s email lists, social media accounts, contacts with local universities, companies, and news media to help spread the word.

The other things you’ll want to make sure of is that you recruit a diverse pool of participants. Reaching out to groups like the Chicago Women in Developers can be super-useful in doing this.

Additionally, you’ll also want to make sure you have a diverse skill set at your event.

The best teams at hackathons are comprised of a mix of skillsets including developers, user interface designers, data scientists, and subject matter experts.

There are a few strategies you can use to try to get a diverse group of people to your event including reaching out to Meetup groups (like other developer groups), contacting web development schools like DevBootcamp, and talking to local universities.

There’s a few ways that you can do registration for the event. For our groups, we like to use Meetup since it allows us to host discussions on the event page. It also help to carry the movement on afterwards since you’ll have people joining your meetup group when they register for the event.
