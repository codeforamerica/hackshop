### Recruit Sponsors

There are a number of costs that are associated with running a hackathon including:

Food (We like deep dish)
Supplies (Pens, markers, paper boards, power strips)
Venue
Your time (Even if you volunteer, youâ€™re still donating your time)

A variety of sponsors can help defray the cost of running your event. Reaching out to local businesses, community foundations, and startup groups is a great way to start. You can also get in-kind donations such as the use of the venue, food, and use of software platforms and hosted space.
