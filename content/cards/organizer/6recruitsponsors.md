### Recruit Sponsors

There are a number of costs that are associated with running a hackathon including:
- Food (We like deep dish)
- Supplies (Pens, markers, paper boards, power strips)
- Venue
- Your time

- [ ] Reach out to local businesses, community foundations, and startup groups 
- [ ] Look for in-kind donations such as venue, food, and use of software platforms or hosted space

Optional, but helpful: 
- [ ] Create a sponsorship packet describing your event with different levels of sponsorship, including options for in-kind donations
