### Find a Venue

Venues can make or break an event. A good venue will help you to ensure that the event runs smoothly, while a bad one will cause you to bounce around like a pinball trying to fix last minute everythings.

When we look for venues to run our events here’s a list of things we look for:

A location easy to get to, ideally near mass transit.
A wifi network that can handle a hundred people at once. (Not always easy)
The venue has either a lot of places to plug in or the ability to place more power strips out.
A venue that has projectors and screens.
A staff member that can be there during the event.
A venue can’t provide anything. Most of the time, this just means food. However, this can include other random items such as:

Dongles (Because nobody has a laptop that will connect to your projector. You need one that links to VGA, Mac to HDMI, Mac to VGA, and so forth and so on.)
Name Badges
Snacks, Water, and Pop (remember to bring the healthy stuff)
Power strips
Post-it notes
White Boards / Paper Easels
Microphones / PA system
Projector, Screen
USB Drives
Swag (laptop stickers, t-shirts)
Directional signage (Where’s the bathroom?)
