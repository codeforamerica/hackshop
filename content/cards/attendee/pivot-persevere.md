### Should you Pivot or Persevere?

What feedback did you get from the feedback lab?

If the feedback confirmed that you're solving the right problem, for the right people, in the right way, awesome! Let's move forward.

If you got feedback that makes you want to rethink your problem, customer segment, or solution, now's the time. Update your lean canvas, and consider going back to the brainstorming and paper prototyping phase to take another shot at it.

Keep iterating until you get feedback that tells you to push on!
