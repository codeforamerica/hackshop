#### What is a UVP? 
Your unique value proposition is the promise you're making to your customer that's compelling enough for them to jump on board.

There are a couple of ways you can think ae way to think about it: 

1) Ask yourself: "If I solve this problem (Box 1) `[by doing this]` for my customer (Box 2), is that compelling?" 

Whatever the `[by doing this]` is the Unique Value Proposition you're proposing.

2) Complete the statement: "I can promise [the customer in Box 1] who faces [the problem in Box 2] that I can give them [unique value proposition in Box 3]."

Don't forget to fill out the `High Level Concept` -- a clear way to describe who you are. For Uber, this would be "Order a taxi with your phone." It can also be an 'x for y' concept like "Instagram for Pet Lovers."
