### Find a problem that's worth solving

A lean canvas is a great way to lay out key components of your business model so you can start testing your assumptions and get to building something customers want *as fast as possible*.

To create a free digital version of a lean canvas, go to [Canvanizer](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas). Alternatively, you can print [this lean canvas](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/12663330/7f1ced9e-c5e4-11e5-9a5d-87582d98bfc3.png)

#### How to write a problem statement

Choose one of these two formats, and write down your problem:

- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` when doing `[type of task]`
- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` because of `[limit or constraint]`

You can have more than one problem statement, but no more than 3. 

#### Identify existing alternatives 
Take time to discuss as a group how people solve this problem today. Document all of the existing ways people solve the problem you want to solve.
