### Find a problem that's worth solving

Go to [Canvanizer](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas) to create a lean canvas. Alternatively, you can print the canvas below.

Then, use stickie notes to fill in Box 1, "Problem" (nothing else!).

#### How to write a problem statement:

Choose one of these two formats, and write your problem on a stickie.

- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` when doing `[type of task]`
- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` because of `[limit or constraint]`

You can have more than one problem statement, but no more than 3.
