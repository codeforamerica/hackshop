### Find a problem that's worth solving

Grab a lean canvas, if you don't have one already:

![Lean Canvas](http://1zdtw21ubuji3i00b23nl364.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-14-at-9.38.44-AM.png)

Then, use stickie notes to fill in Box 1, "Problem" (nothing else!).

#### How to write a problem statement:

Choose one of these two formats, and write your problem on a stickie.

- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` when doing `[type of task]`
- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` because of `[limit or constraint]`

You can have more than problem statement, but no more than 3.
