### Paper Prototypes

You should have several ideas from your brainstorming session. Now, take one idea each (can be a group of ideas that were similar), and spend 5 minutes building a paper prototype.

#### How to build a paper prototype

It's literally using a piece of paper and a sharpie to draw what you think the solution is. 

No one expects it to be pretty, don't worry! Add as much detail as you can to get across how it might look and work.
