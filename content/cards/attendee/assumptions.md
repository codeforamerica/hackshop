### Test your Guesses

By now you should have:
- Boxes 1-4 filled out on your lean canvas
- a paper prototype of a solution

So far we've made a bunch of guesses. What problems *we* think exist, what customers *we* think have that problem, and what solution *we* think would solve it.

Before moving on, we need to test those assumptions with some potential customers.

At 10am we'll have a feedback panel to help you do this. Bring your lean canvas and your paper prototype!

For extra credit, try to find people who fit your customer segment and talk to them. Call your friends, find people on twitter, even pick up the phone and call businesses. The more people you can talk to the better!
